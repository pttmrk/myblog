_This page was born as my modest attempt to summarize the entire spectre of human knowledge._

I am well aware of how absurd the previous sentence sounds. Our minds being as limited as they are, there are only so many ideas we can realistically  hope to learn, retain and apply in a world that is getting more complicated by the day. Trying to make sense of the swirling chaos around us can only lead to madness.  
We need a guide to structure our thinking, a map to navigate the oceans of life. We need _mental models_.

# **What Are Mental Models?**

> _A mental model is an explanation of how something works. The phrase “mental model” is an overarching term for any sort of concept, framework, or worldview that you carry around in your mind._

The idea was introduced in its current form by Charlie Munger, of Berkshire Hathaway fame, in his speech on [Elementary Worldly Wisdom](https://old.ycombinator.com/munger.html):

> “What is elementary, worldly wisdom? Well, the first rule is that you can't really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang 'em back. If the facts don't hang together on a latticework of theory, you don't have them in a usable form.  
> You've got to have models in your head. And you've got to array your experience—both vicarious and direct—on this latticework of models. What you need is a latticework of mental models in your head. And, with that system, things gradually get to fit together in a way that enhances cognition.”

Among the many followers of Buffett and Munger who explored this premise, the best contribution is coming from the wonderful [Farnam Street](https://www.fs.blog/), who has brought mental models into mainstream discourse. Shane's introductory video is well worth a look:

What kinds of knowledge are we talking about adding to our repertoire?

> “You must know the big ideas in the big disciplines and use them routinely – all of them, not just a few.
> It's the big, basic ideas of all the truly fundamental academic disciplines. The stuff you should have learned in the “101” course of each major subject but probably didn't.  
> These are the true general principles that underlie most of what's going on in the world. Things like: The main laws of physics. The main ideas driving chemistry. The big, useful tools of mathematics. The guiding principles of biology. The hugely useful concepts from human psychology. The central principles of systems thinking. The working concepts behind business and markets.

This page wants to be a reference to these fundamental concepts, with the explicit objective of building a framework of models to navigate the immensely complex world we live in. A perpetual work in progress, it's  the place where I collect and organize new knowledge as I come across it.  
In order to keep the list manageable, models included in this list should have three properties:

### Concrete

While there are many beautiful and fascinating ideas in the worlds of mathematics or philosophy, those concepts are often not directly applicable to life's situations. These models are all in some way or another related to situations we might encounter in everyday life.

### Cross-domain

In order to be useful, these concepts must be general and applicable over a wide range of situations. Knowing the laws governing the trajectory of a projectile is certainly important, but unlikely to help us solve problems unrelated to cannons and rifles. On the other hand, understanding ideas such as _entropy_ or _inflation_ will prove useful in a much wider range of occasions.

### Predictive

The main objective in studying and learning mental models is to be able to understand reality in order to make better decisions. Applying the right tool to the given situation should help you make a prediction on what could happen next. Models lacking descriptive power or inherently unfalsifiable are not included.

> "All models are wrong, but some are useful."

I have come across a wide variety of attempts to build similar lists[^1], but I have always found those incomplete, very limited in scope and presented in a way that made them difficult to remember.  
I will try to present a broad selection of useful models and ideas, without sprawling on irrelevant or redundant concepts and providing an example and a visual cue for each of them to help recalling. A lot of entries are taken from existing lists (that I encourage you to check out!) but many more were added by me.

While mainly intended for my own fruition, I hope this collection was useful to you too. If that's the case, feel free to reach out and send me any comment or suggestion on how it can be improved.  
Thank you and keep on learning!
