Hello there! My name is Marco Patti, based in Milan, Italy.
I started this blog in 2019 as a way to express my ideas and engage in the global conversation. I always write with the intent of being interesting for my audience, so this is the one page where I can write all about myself, without feeling the need for it to be useful.

<i class="fa fa-briefcase about-icon fa-fw"></i> 
 Currently working as data engineer for [FinconsGroup](http://www.finconsgroup.com/). My Resume as of 2019 is available [here](/cv.md). 

<i class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon fa-fw"></i>
 I hold a degree in Finance and Economics from [Bocconi University](http://unibocconi.it), and that's supposed to count for something for some people.

<i class="fa fa-book about-icon fa-fw"></i> 
 I enjoy reading books and articles on a broad range of topics. A curated list of favorites can be found [here](/books).

<i class="fa fa-code about-icon fa-fw"></i> 
 I love building things, learning and experimenting in new projects. Some of the most fun I've ever had was in working closely with a nimble team in a startup, creating value out of nothing. If you need a business and tech savvy person to join your project and create something awesome, I am actively looking for new opportunities! 

<i class="fa fa-envelope about-icon fa-fw"></i>
 I am eager to meet new people, connect, discuss, network and grow, so if you like anything here feel free to follow the social media links or drop an [email](<mailto:email@example.com>).
